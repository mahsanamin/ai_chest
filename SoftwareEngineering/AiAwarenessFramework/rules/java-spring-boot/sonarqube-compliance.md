# SonarQube Compliance

Rules to prevent common SonarQube findings. Apply when writing or reviewing Java code. These are the findings reviewers catch by hand most often — encode them so they never reach review.

For formatting, imports (no fully-qualified names), and AOP annotation placement, see `coding-conventions.md` — not repeated here.

## Swagger / OpenAPI Annotations

- **Do NOT use** `@Schema(required = true)` — the `required` attribute is deprecated. Omit it: `@Schema(description = "...")`. Requiredness is controlled by validation annotations (`@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`) and the OpenAPI spec, not by `@Schema.required`.

```java
// Bad — deprecated attribute
@Schema(description = "Category ID", required = true)
private Integer categoryId;

// Good — drop required; @NotNull conveys it
@NotNull
@Schema(description = "Category ID")
private Integer categoryId;
```

## Boxed Type Equality (`S4973`, BUG severity)

`==` and `!=` on `Integer`, `Long`, `String`, or any reference type are **reference comparisons**, not value comparisons. For boxed integers they only happen to work inside the `-128..127` cache range — the bug hides in tests with small IDs and surfaces in production once IDs grow.

Use `Objects.equals(a, b)` (null-safe) or `a.equals(b)` when both sides are known non-null. Primitive `int`/`long`/`boolean` comparisons with `==`/`!=` are fine — the rule only applies to reference types.

```java
// Bad — entity.getId() is a boxed Integer; this is reference comparison
if (resolved.getId() != base.getId()) { ... }

// Good — value comparison, null-safe
if (!Objects.equals(resolved.getId(), base.getId())) { ... }
```

Watch the hidden case: a JPA `getId()` looks numeric but usually returns a boxed `Integer` (so the column can be `NULL` before insert). Treat any non-primitive return type as a reference-comparison hazard.

## Loop Control Flow (`S135`)

Keep `break` and `continue` to **at most one per loop**. Multiple exits force the reader to track several paths and obscure the termination condition. Most cases collapse into a single loop condition or an extracted helper. An early `return` is a method-level exit and is **not** flagged.

```java
// Bad — two breaks, ambiguous exit
while (true) {
  List<Foo> batch = repo.findPage(cursor, PAGE_SIZE);
  if (batch.isEmpty()) break;
  for (Foo foo : batch) process(foo);
  if (batch.size() < PAGE_SIZE) break;
}

// Good — single exit via loop condition (iterating an empty batch is a no-op)
boolean more = true;
while (more) {
  List<Foo> batch = repo.findPage(cursor, PAGE_SIZE);
  for (Foo foo : batch) process(foo);
  more = batch.size() == PAGE_SIZE;
}
```

If the in-loop work takes the whole batch (`process(batch)`), an empty list isn't a no-op — guard with `if (!batch.isEmpty())` before dropping the empty-check break, or use the `for`-over-batch idiom above which sidesteps it.

## Dead Code (`S2094`, `S1130`)

- Remove unused private fields, parameters, and imports.
- Remove `throws` declarations for exceptions the body can't actually throw (`S1130`) — common on tests written as `void myTest() throws Exception` with no throwing call.
- **Delete empty classes** rather than keeping them as future-extension placeholders (`S2094`). Empty marker classes referenced only as framework placeholders (e.g. `@FeignClient(configuration = EmptyConfig.class)`) are still flagged — drop the framework reference and let defaults apply until you actually need to override something.

```java
// Bad — empty class kept "for future use", flagged by S2094
public class FeatureClientConfig {}

@FeignClient(name = "x", url = "${...}", configuration = FeatureClientConfig.class)
public interface FeatureClient { ... }

// Good — drop the placeholder and the configuration attribute
@FeignClient(name = "x", url = "${...}")
public interface FeatureClient { ... }
```

## Mockito Matchers (`S6068`)

Don't wrap raw values in `eq()` when no other matcher is in play — Mockito accepts raw values directly when *all* arguments are concrete. Only use `eq()` when at least one argument is an `any*()` (or other) matcher, because Mockito's all-or-nothing rule then requires every argument to be a matcher.

```java
// Bad — pointless eq() wrappers (S6068)
when(svc.getItem(eq(2), eq("en"))).thenReturn(item);

// Good — pass values directly
when(svc.getItem(2, "en")).thenReturn(item);

// Good — eq() required when mixed with another matcher
verify(svc, never()).getItem(anyInt(), eq("en"));
```

**`verifyNoInteractions(mock)` over `verify(mock, never()).method(anyString())`** when asserting a dependency was untouched: the `never()` form with `anyString()` silently misses a call made with a `null` argument (`anyString()` rejects null), so a real violation passes. `verifyNoInteractions` catches any call.

## AssertJ / Test Assertion Idioms (`S5838`, `S5853`, `S5778`)

- **Semantic methods:** `isZero()` over `isEqualTo(0)`; `isEmpty()` over `isEqualTo("")`/`hasSize(0)`; `isOne()`; `isTrue()`/`isFalse()` over `isEqualTo(true/false)`.
- **`containsEntry(k, v)`** for a map key/value (`S5838`) instead of `assertThat(map.get(k)).isEqualTo(v)`.
- **One throwing call per `assertThatThrownBy` lambda** (`S5778`) — the lambda must hold only the call expected to throw, or the assertion is ambiguous.
- **`BigDecimal`:** compare with `isEqualByComparingTo` (or `compareTo`), never `isEqualTo`/`equals` — the latter are scale-sensitive (`2.0` ≠ `2.00`). The same trap hits `containsEntry` on a `Map<_, BigDecimal>`.

```java
// Bad — scale-sensitive, brittle
assertThat(total).isEqualTo(new BigDecimal("2.0"));
assertThat(count).isEqualTo(0);

// Good
assertThat(total).isEqualByComparingTo("2.0");
assertThat(count).isZero();
```

## Test Quality

- Every `@Test` method must contain **at least one assertion** (`assertThat`, `assertThatThrownBy`, …). Action-only tests are flagged Blocker.
- Empty catch blocks need a comment explaining why the exception is intentionally ignored.
- Avoid commented-out code, including prose containing tokens like `<=` or identifiers that the parser reads as commented-out code (`S125`) — delete it; version history preserves intent.

## Spring Proxy Self-Invocation

`@Cacheable`/`@Transactional` called via `this`, or placed on a non-public method, silently bypass the proxy — the annotation has no effect. **Canonical fix:** the helper pattern in `coding-conventions.md` § AOP Annotation Placement (annotations on `public` methods only; same-class callers use an unannotated package-private helper or `TransactionTemplate`). See also `transaction-boundaries.md`.
