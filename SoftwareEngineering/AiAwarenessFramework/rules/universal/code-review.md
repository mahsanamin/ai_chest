# Code Review Standards

Shared knowledge base for all code review workflows. This file defines **what to check** - skills (`aa-task-flow-review`, `aa-review-pr`) define **how to drive** the review.

## Review Agent

All reviews are performed by the project-specific code reviewer agent (e.g., `.claude/agents/{project}-code-reviewer/AGENT.md`), or the generic `aa-code-reviewer` agent if no project-specific one exists. The agent reads this file and the rule files selected by the invoking skill.

## Review Entry Points

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `aa-task-flow-review` | During aa-task-flow workflow - after code implementation, before PR |
| `aa-review-pr` | Standalone - review any PR by number or URL |

Both skills generate a diff, load these rules, and delegate to the same agent.

## Review Criteria

### Architecture & Design
- Changes in correct module per `project-structure.md`
- Layer separation maintained (e.g., controller → service → repository)
- Dependency direction respected per project conventions
- Design patterns consistent with existing codebase
- Dependency injection follows project conventions

### Transaction Boundaries (CRITICAL)
**Reference**: `transaction-boundaries.md`

If `@Transactional` methods are in the diff, verify whether these issues actually exist:
- Calls to external APIs inside the transaction → **BLOCKING** (confirm the call is actually inside the boundary, not in a separate method)
- `Thread.sleep()` inside transaction → **BLOCKING**
- File I/O operations inside transaction → **BLOCKING**
- Queue/messaging operations inside transaction → **BLOCKING**
- Method >30 lines (likely mixed concerns) → **WARNING**
- `noRollbackFor` usage (often hides external ops) → **WARNING**

### Query Efficiency (CRITICAL)
**Reference**: `query-efficiency.md`

Verify whether these patterns actually occur in the changed code:
- `findAll()` when specific IDs are already known → **BLOCKING** (confirm the caller has the IDs)
- `.stream().filter()` after `findAll()` (app-level filtering) → **BLOCKING** (confirm a query-level filter is possible)
- `repository.find*()` inside `for`/`forEach`/`stream().map()` → **BLOCKING** (read the actual loop, don't guess from method name)
- `entity.getLazyCollection()` inside loop → **BLOCKING** (confirm the collection is lazy and the loop exists)
- Method re-querying data the caller already holds → **WARNING** (trace the actual caller to verify)
- Helper method accepts ID instead of entity/map (hidden query) → **WARNING**
- Same `findById(id)` called in multiple methods → **WARNING**
- Missing batch methods (`findByIdIn`) in repository → **WARNING**

### Database Migrations
**Reference**: `database-migrations.md`

- Entity/enum change MUST have corresponding migration file → **BLOCKING** if missing
- Migration naming follows project convention
- Uses safe DDL patterns (`IF NOT EXISTS`/`IF EXISTS`)
- Proper dependency ordering (FK target table created first)

### JPA Repositories
**Reference**: `jpa-repositories.md`

- Nullable parameters handled for DB compatibility
- Soft-delete queries include deleted-at check where applicable
- Prefer method-name queries over `@Query` for simple cases
- `@Modifying` annotation on DELETE/UPDATE queries
- Never access lazy collections outside transaction

### API Conventions
**Reference**: `api-conventions.md`

- Request flow follows project conventions
- URL patterns follow project standards
- Proper error handling and HTTP status codes
- When ALL query parameters are optional, require "at least one" validation

### Code Quality
**Reference**: `coding-conventions.md`

- Follows project formatting and naming standards
- No wildcard imports
- Project utility patterns applied correctly
- Constants only if used 3+ times

### Module Structure
**Reference**: `project-structure.md`

- New files in correct module per project structure
- Layer responsibilities respected

### Metrics & Observability
**Reference**: `metrics-collection.md` (if present)

- New features consider metrics collection
- Consistent naming conventions for events

### Critical Thinking
**Reference**: `critical-thinking.md`

- No breaking changes without migration path
- No anti-patterns (duplication, unnecessary complexity)
- Shared enums used correctly
- Question requests that violate established patterns

### Test Changes
**Reference**: `test-change-policy.md`

- **Unjustified / weakened test edit:** a diff that modifies, deletes, or relaxes existing test assertions **without** a corresponding public/observable contract change. For a BEHAVIOR_PRESERVING change the existing suite is the regression oracle — editing it to go green destroys the evidence that behaviour was preserved. Flag any modified test hunk that does not map to a named contract delta.
- Watch specifically for: loosened assertions (tightened→`anyOf`, exact→`contains`), deleted test cases, `@Disabled`/`@Ignore` added, expected values changed to match new output on a "refactor", mocks widened to swallow a new call.

### Test Scope
**Reference**: `test-scope-policy.md`

- **Implementation-coupled / framework-tautology test:** a test that asserts an internal mechanism or a framework/third-party guarantee instead of the observable contract. Flag a mocked collaborator's call used as a proxy for correctness (e.g. asserting a persistence write happened, or call ordering on a mock) — against a mock this only proves the mock ran. → **WARNING** (BLOCKING when it is the only assertion standing in for a real persisted-state or side-effect guarantee that an integration test against the real datastore should cover).
- **Allowed:** interaction assertions where the collaboration IS the contract and is not otherwise visible (queue/stream publish, external notification/API call, exactly-once/idempotency). Do not flag these.

## Severity Criteria

Use these criteria to determine how severe an issue is. The invoking skill defines the exact labels and output format.

### Must block merge
- N+1 queries in loops (will multiply with scale)
- Transaction holding connection during external call
- Schema change without migration
- Wrong module placement
- Breaking API change without compatibility
- Entity mutations that are never persisted

### Should review, may not block
- Method >30 lines (likely mixed concerns)
- `noRollbackFor` usage (often hides external ops)
- Method re-querying data the caller already holds
- Missing batch methods in repository
- Test assertions weakened/removed on a behaviour-preserving change without a contract delta (block if it masks a real regression)
- Test asserts an internal mechanism or framework guarantee (mock-call proxy) instead of the observable contract (block if it is the only stand-in for a real persisted-state/side-effect guarantee)

### Does not block
- Style preferences beyond what linters enforce
- Missing Javadoc on non-public method
- Performance optimization that doesn't affect correctness
- Method slightly over 30 lines

**Output format**: Defined by the invoking skill (`aa-review-pr` or `aa-task-flow-review`), not this file. This file defines **what to check and how severe it is**.
