# Cross-Team Framing

Rules for how AI-written content references other teams in internal docs, status reports, weekly reports, and PR discussions. Applies whenever the document might be read by leadership, peer teams, or the CEO/CTO.

These rules exist because political framing in written status — naming peer teams as the gap, the blocker, or the reason — leaks into management copy and creates friction that's not in the team's interest. Honest neutral framing protects credibility and keeps cross-team relationships intact.

## What to avoid

- **Don't name another team as the owner of a gap, blocker, or missing process.**
  - ❌ "Products team hasn't delivered the upstream endpoint"
  - ❌ "Blocked on infrastructure"
  - ❌ "Waiting on backoffice"
  - ❌ "Items' system has not been reported yet"
- **Don't reference unrelated prior incidents from other teams** to strengthen a point against a currently named team. ("X had a similar incident" used as ammunition is a giveaway.)
- **Don't write `Need from: [team X]` / `blocked on [team X]` / `pending [team X] action`** as the framing.

## What to do instead

Frame cross-team situations abstractly. The leadership audience already knows the company context — they don't need names to understand the situation.

- "cross-system API change-notification gap"
- "upstream systems"
- "platform-wide environment setup"
- "a lightweight process across teams would reduce risk"
- "pending platform-wide rollout"
- "upstream domain experts are involved during planning"
- "follow-ups pending, staging proof-of-concept planned"

## Check before writing "blocked on" anything

Before writing "blocked on [team X]" or "pending [team X] action", verify whether your own team has actually raised the ask:

- Was a ticket filed?
- Was a Slack message sent?
- Was a meeting requested?

If no — the next step is yours, not theirs. Write it that way:

- "next step is to raise the ask"
- "pending Example-side initiation"
- "code is ready; no ticket raised yet"

## Company-wide causes

When a slowdown's underlying cause is company-wide (restructuring, cross-team staffing transitions, shared environment issues), describe it that way rather than picking a single team to attribute it to. The CEO and CTO know the company context; honest neutral framing protects credibility without throwing anyone under the bus.

## Why this matters

A status report or PR description that names a peer team as the blocker, when read by leadership, reads as political even when the team did nothing wrong by raising it. The neutral framing — same underlying facts, different lens — surfaces the same engineering reality without the political shape. Both audiences (your leadership and the peer team) come out informed and unembarrassed.
