# project-noise-lint.sh — SURFACE project-based-noise candidates in the framework repo.
#
# Twin of generic-skill-lint.sh. That script hard-fails on STACK idioms in skill/agent
# bodies (unambiguous). This one surfaces BUSINESS / PROJECT noise — a source project's
# identity leaking into the project-AGNOSTIC framework. Two shapes of noise:
#
#   1. PROJECT_NOISE — a real project's identity inside an INSTALLED artifact (rules/,
#      skills/, agents/, templates/, setup.md): name, package, dev path, ticket, email,
#      SHA, dated incident note, version-history prose. Rules carry stack idioms; they
#      must never carry a real project's identity.
#   2. PROJECT_SCOPED_ARTIFACT — a whole file whose NAME or DOMINANT CONTENT binds the
#      generic framework to ONE specific project: a "<project>-feedback.md" mining doc,
#      a doc that declares a "Source project:", a file named after a product line. The
#      framework keeps the DISTILLED GENERIC OUTPUT (rules); the project-bound analysis
#      belongs in the source project or scratch space, NOT committed here. This is the
#      class the docs/ tree hides — so docs/ IS scanned (it used to be exempt; that was
#      the blind spot that let docs/plans/acme-spring-boot-feedback.md through).
#
# Noise-vs-legitimate is CONTEXTUAL, so this script emits CANDIDATES grouped by finding
# type for the /aa-self-reviewer judgment pass (and the human) to adjudicate.
# The unambiguous hard-fail lives in generic-skill-lint.sh; this is the wide net.
#
# Scope (default --changed is the useful one — a clean PR adds zero noise):
#   project-noise-lint.sh                # CHANGED files vs main (git diff) — default
#   project-noise-lint.sh --all          # every scanned artifact (audit; noisy on legacy)
#   project-noise-lint.sh <file> [file…] # the given files (used by evals)
#
# Scanned: rules/ skills/ agents/ templates/ setup.md (PROJECT_NOISE) AND docs/ (mostly
# PROJECT_SCOPED_ARTIFACT). NOT scanned: CHANGELOG.md (the designated history — it may name
# the project that motivated a change), README/VERSIONING, .claude/commands/ (dev tools).
#
# Exit 0 = no candidates. Exit 1 = at least one candidate to adjudicate. Exit 2 = usage error.

# CUSTOMIZE THIS: a `|`-separated list of YOUR product/project line slugs that must not
# name or dominate a framework file. Keep it to genuine product lines — NOT shared
# libraries/platforms (e.g. the base framework) or generic repo-name patterns, which
# legitimately recur across rules and would false-fire. The defaults below are fictional
# placeholders for the framework's own self-tests; replace them with your real product
# lines. The structural signals below (Source-project line, *-feedback filename) catch
# project-bound docs even when the slug isn't listed, so this list is a bonus, not the
# only defense. Override at runtime with PROJECT_SLUGS=... in the environment.
