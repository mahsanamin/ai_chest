description: Initialize issue-tracker integration for Claude Code. For GitHub Issues (the default) this verifies the gh CLI is authenticated — no MCP needed. For Jira (Atlassian) or Linear it sets up the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Say "aa-init-mcps" or "setup mcps".

# Initialize Issue-Tracker Integration

Set up the integration for the project's configured issue tracker.

## When to Use

- First time wiring up the project's issue tracker
- aa-task-flow needs ticket access but the integration isn't configured
- User says "aa-init-mcps", "setup mcps", or "configure mcp"

## Step 0: Resolve the Tracker (do this FIRST)

Read `tracker.type` from `.claude/config_hints.json` (under `project`). Branch on it —
this is the same `tracker` seam as the Tracker Dispatch Table in
`rules/universal/mcp-integration.md`:

```bash
TRACKER=$(jq -r '.project.tracker.type // "github"' .claude/config_hints.json 2>/dev/null)
```

| `tracker.type` | What this skill does |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **`github`** (default) | **No MCP needed** — GitHub Issues uses the `gh` CLI. Just verify `gh auth status` (see below). |
| **`jira`** | Set up the Atlassian MCP server (Jira / Confluence) — see the Atlassian section. |
| **`linear`** | Set up the Linear MCP server, then follow the same dispatch rows. |
| **`none`** | Nothing to configure — identifiers are managed manually. |

### GitHub Issues path (`tracker.type: github`)

No MCP server is required. Verify the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

- If authenticated, you're done — aa-task-flow uses `gh issue ...` directly.
- If not, run `gh auth login` and re-check.
- If `gh` is missing, install it (`brew install gh` / your platform's package manager).

The rest of this skill is the **MCP setup path**, used only when `tracker.type` is `jira`
(Atlassian) or `linear`.

## What are MCP Servers?

MCP servers allow Claude Code to:
- Fetch Jira tickets and issues
- Read/write Confluence pages
- Access other external services
- Integrate with your development tools

## Checking Current MCP Status

Before setting up, check if MCP servers are already configured:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

If the command returns servers, MCP is already configured. Ask user if they want to add more.

## Available MCP Servers

### 1. Atlassian (Jira & Confluence)

**What it provides:**
- Read Jira tickets and issues
- Create/update Jira issues and descriptions
- Add comments to Jira tickets
- Read Confluence pages
- Search across Jira and Confluence

**aa-task-flow Integration:**
- Start tasks from Jira tickets (ticket-first approach)
- Automatically update ticket description when task completes
- Archive original description to comments
- Add completion status and branch info

**Setup command:**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp
```

**After setup:**
1. You'll be prompted to authenticate via browser
2. Grant permissions to Claude Code
3. Server will be available immediately

**Enables in aa-task-flow:**
- Ticket-first approach: Start tasks from Jira URLs
- Auto-fetch ticket descriptions to raw_prompt.md
- Auto-update tickets on completion with:
  - Original description archived to comments
  - Updated description from ticket.md
  - Completion status and branch info

### 2. Linear (`tracker.type: linear`)

Configure the Linear MCP server, then drive it through the same dispatch rows in
`rules/universal/mcp-integration.md` (fetch / search / create / update / link).

### 3. Future MCP Servers

As more MCP servers become available, add them here:
- Slack MCP (when available)

(GitHub Issues needs no MCP — it uses the `gh` CLI; see Step 0.)

## Setup Flow

### Step 1: Check Existing Configuration

```bash
claude mcp list
```

### Step 2: Add Atlassian MCP

If not already configured:

```
To integrate with Jira and Confluence, run:

  claude mcp add --scope user --transport http atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp

This will:
1. Open your browser for authentication
2. Ask for Jira/Confluence permissions
3. Enable Claude to read/write tickets and pages

After setup, you can:
- Fetch Jira tickets by URL or ID
- Create tasks from Jira descriptions
- Search Confluence documentation
- Create/update Jira issues directly
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup

After user runs the command:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Should show:
```
atlassian (http://...)
```

### Step 4: Test Connection

Try fetching a test resource to verify:

Ask user: "Do you have a Jira ticket URL I can test with?"

If yes, attempt to fetch it using MCP tools.

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: claude mcp"

User needs to update Claude Code CLI:
```bash
npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### "Authentication failed"

1. Check browser didn't block the auth popup
2. Try running the add command again
3. Ensure user has access to Atlassian instance

### "Permission denied"

MCP scope might be wrong. Use `--scope user` for user-level config.

## Integration with Task Flow

When `aa-task-flow` needs tracker access (for the ticket-first approach), it resolves
`tracker.type` first:
1. **github** — verify `gh auth status`; no MCP step.
2. **jira / linear** — check the MCP server is configured; if not, invoke this skill to set it up, then continue.
3. **none** — skip; identifiers are managed manually.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `claude mcp list` | Show configured servers |
| `claude mcp add ...` | Add new server |
| `claude mcp remove <name>` | Remove server |
| `claude mcp test <name>` | Test server connection |

## Notes

- MCP configuration is stored at user level (not project level)
- Once configured, available across all projects
- Credentials are managed securely by Claude Code
- Can add multiple MCP servers simultaneously
