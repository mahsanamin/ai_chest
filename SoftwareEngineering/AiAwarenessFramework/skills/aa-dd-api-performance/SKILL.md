description: Scan a window of Datadog traffic (default last day, production), sample traces for every API above the latency/error thresholds, cross-reference the code in this repo, and maintain per-API optimization report files (status + change detection) under the workspace Performance_Findings directory, per environment — then auto-commit and push the findings to the workspace repo. Use for "api performance scan", "which APIs are slow", "update the performance reports", "run on staging", or any recurring Datadog latency sweep of this service. Say "aa-dd-api-performance". On-demand only (Datadog MCP is interactively authenticated).

# Datadog API Performance Scan

Discover which APIs were hit in the configured window (default: the last day), find the slow ones, explain *why* they are slow (which internal calls, which code), and keep one living report file per slow API per environment. Re-runs are cheap and idempotent: a report is only rewritten when its findings actually change — that's what makes this safe to run daily in a loop without drowning the findings directory in noise.

Sibling of `aa-api-dd-compare`: that skill is a one-off deep audit of a trace the user hands you; this skill is the automated sweep that *finds* the endpoints worth auditing and tracks them over time.

Detect this repo's language/framework at runtime and reason in its idioms — nothing below is Java-specific except the examples.

## Prerequisites

- **Datadog MCP connected** (interactively authenticated). If unavailable, say so and stop. This matters for loops: a cron/headless run without the MCP must fail loudly, not silently produce an empty report.
- The repo this skill lives in is checked out — code cross-referencing reads the *current working tree*.

## Configuration (resolve once per run, persist on first run)

Read `.claude/skill.config`. The skill owns a `datadog_performance` block:

```json
"datadog_performance": {
  "service": "{your-service-name}",
  "env": "production",
  "latency_threshold_ms": 200,
  "error_rate_threshold_pct": 5,
  "window": "now-1d",
  "samples_per_api": 4
}
```

- **Missing block (first run):** auto-detect the service via `search_datadog_services` using the repo directory name. Proceed without asking only when the match is unambiguous: an exact name match, or a single candidate that contains / is contained by the dir name. Confirm the candidate has span traffic (`aggregate_spans` count > 0 in the window), write the block with the defaults above, and tell the user what was persisted.
- **Zero or multiple plausible candidates:** stop with a clear message listing what was found — never scan a guessed service. On any resolution failure, persist nothing to `skill.config`.
- Note: `skill.config` may contain non-JSON trailer lines after the JSON object — preserve them when writing.

**Run-time overrides (session-only):** the invocation may override any config value in plain words or `key=value` form — "run on staging", "aa-dd-api-performance env=staging", "scan the last 6 hours" (`window=now-6h`), "threshold 500ms". Apply overrides for this run only — **never persist them to `skill.config`**; the block always holds the defaults. Typical usage: the configured default env (production) runs in the scheduled loop; staging is invoked manually on demand (e.g. to watch an API being optimized while it's still in testing).

**Findings root** (priority order):
1. `paths.performance_findings_root` in `.claude/skill.config` (explicit override)
2. Derived: `coding_tasks_root = dirname(paths.tasks_root)`; replace the `_Coding_Tasks` suffix of its basename with `_Performance_Findings`, as a sibling directory. Example: `.../{workspace}/{Project}_Coding_Tasks` → `.../{workspace}/{Project}_Performance_Findings`. If the basename has no `_Coding_Tasks` suffix, use `dirname(coding_tasks_root)/Performance_Findings`.
3. Fallback (no tasks_root): `.claude/performance-findings/` in this repo.

Reports **always** live under an environment directory placed directly inside `DataDog/`: `{findings_root}/Backend/DataDog/{Env}/API_Performance/` where `{Env}` is the capitalized env name (`Production/`, `Staging/`). Env-first keeps each environment an independent tracking universe — its own report files, its own `_index.md`, its own fingerprints and History — and leaves room for future sibling report categories per env (e.g. `DataDog/Production/DB_Performance/`). A staging sweep can never add noise to production stats or vice versa. If files from an older skill layout exist (`DataDog/API_Performance/` root or `DataDog/API_Performance/{Env}/`), move them into `{Env}/API_Performance/` before proceeding (one-time migration, note it in that env's run log). Create directory trees only when you reach the write step (step 6) — a run that stops early (prerequisites, resolution failure) must leave no orphan directories behind.

## Flow

### 1. Discover the window's API traffic

`aggregate_spans` over `service:{service} env:{env} @span.kind:server` for the window, grouped by `resource_name` (limit 200), computing on `@duration` (**nanoseconds!**): `COUNT`, `P50`, `P95`, `MAX`. If the response reports dropped percentile computes, retry once with the field spelled `duration` — which spelling works varies with the query shape. Run a second aggregation with ` status:error` appended to get per-resource error counts; join the two to compute error rate.

Keep only buckets whose `resource_name` starts with an HTTP verb (`GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE|HEAD|OPTIONS` + space). The two filters are both necessary: the verb-prefix rule drops framework-handler duplicates (`FooController.bar`) and db/cache spans, while `@span.kind:server` drops verb-prefixed **outbound client** spans (e.g. `GET /ext/api/v3/Document/Fees` to an external host) that would otherwise show up as phantom APIs and get their own bogus report files. If zero verb-prefixed buckets survive, drop the `@span.kind:server` filter and retry once (some tracers don't tag it) — but then check surviving buckets' sampled spans for an external `peer.hostname`/`http.url` and exclude any that are outbound calls.

Display a one-screen traffic table (endpoint, hits, p50/p95 ms, error %), marking which rows breach the gate.

### 2. Gate

An API is **flagged** when, in this window:
- `p95 > latency_threshold_ms`, **or**
- `error_rate ≥ error_rate_threshold_pct` (slow OR broken both deserve a file)

Also load the set of **previously tracked** APIs (existing files in this env's `{Env}/API_Performance/`). Three populations result:
- *flagged + tracked* → refresh
- *flagged + new* → create
- *not flagged + tracked* → if it had traffic this window, re-evaluate (it may have recovered); if it had **no traffic**, leave the file completely untouched and mark "no traffic this window" only in the index.

### 3. Analyze each flagged API (parallelize)

When more than 2 APIs need analysis, fan out one subagent per API (steps 3a–4), each returning the report sections + fingerprint inputs; sanity-check each result against the actual diff/trace evidence before writing files (subagents can hallucinate). First verify the Datadog MCP tools are reachable from a subagent (they load via ToolSearch); if they are not, run the analyses inline sequentially instead.

#### 3a. Sample traces

For each flagged API (`samples_per_api` total, default 4):
- `search_datadog_spans` with `service:{service} env:{env} resource_name:"{VERB} {path}"`, sort `-@duration` → take the 2 slowest
- same query with `@duration:[{p95*0.8} TO {p95*1.2}]` → 1 "typical-slow" sample (**round to integer nanoseconds** — Datadog rejects float range bounds)
- 1 near the median (`@duration:[p50*0.8 TO p50*1.2]`, also integers)
- if the API was flagged for errors, swap one slot for a `status:error` sample

If the window has fewer hits than `samples_per_api`, use every available trace and mark the report header `(low-confidence, N={hits})`. Never confirm the repetition/cache heuristics (#1, #2) from a single trace — one request can't distinguish a legitimate cache miss from a bypassed cache; record such suspicions as hypotheses to re-check on a busier window, not as findings.

Then `get_datadog_trace` per sample. From the children of the entry span build the **breakdown**: group by `(service, operation_name or resource_name)`, sum durations, compute % of the entry-span duration, and classify each group (db / cache / outbound-http / internal compute). Note sequential-vs-parallel layout of the outbound calls (compare child start/end timestamps).

### 4. Cross-reference the code

Map the route to its handler in the working tree (search route path → controller/handler → service methods). For each significant breakdown group (≥10% of total or ≥100ms), find the code site that issues it (`file:line`): the client call, the repository/query, the cache annotation that should have prevented it.

Apply the heuristics catalog. If `aa-api-dd-compare` is installed in this repo (`.claude/skills/aa-api-dd-compare/SKILL.md`), read its catalog — it is the maintained, extended version. Otherwise use this compact copy (runtime signal → hypothesis):

1. Same outbound/DB call repeated N× in one trace → ineffective/bypassed cache or missing request-scope memoization
2. Code declares caching but trace shows a fetch every request → cache not taking effect
3. Independent outbound calls running strictly sequentially → parallelization candidate
4. Outbound call hits a public edge host while siblings use internal endpoints → wrong/slow routing
5. Live external call for data an existing sync job already lands locally → read the local store
6. Same write/read repeated far beyond the rows it touches → flush amplification / N+1
7. Auth/token acquisition inside the request hot path → token-cache candidate

Each finding needs trace evidence (counts, ms) + a code location + an estimated saving. No speculative findings — if the trace doesn't show it, it isn't a finding.

### 5. Status

Pick exactly one (first match wins):

| Status | Rule |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **Many Errors** | error rate ≥ `error_rate_threshold_pct` |
| 🚨 **Optimization Must** | p95 > 1s, **or** p95 > threshold with at least one concrete catalog finding (a fix exists) |
| ✅ **Normal** | p95 ≤ threshold **and** error rate < 1% (a tracked API that recovered) |
| ⚠️ **Needs Attention** | everything else — e.g. p95 between threshold and 1s with no concrete fix yet, or error rate in the 1%–threshold grey zone |

(⚠️ is deliberately the catch-all so every API always gets a status. Note a deliberate consequence: a sub-1s endpoint sampled at N=1 can never reach 🚨 — findings require multi-trace evidence, and escalating on a single observation would be guessing. It will escalate on the first busy window that confirms a finding.)

### 6. Write / update report files

**Filename:** `{VERB}_{path}.md` with `/` → `_`, `{}` stripped, e.g. `POST_api_v1_items_id_verify.md`.

**File format:**

```markdown
<!-- aa-dd-api-performance
fingerprint: {status}|{p95_bucket}|{bottleneck_set}|{findings_ids}
last_run: {ISO timestamp}
last_changed: {ISO timestamp}
-->
# {VERB} {path}

**Status: 🚨 Optimization Must** · p95 {X}ms · {hits} hits/window · {err}% errors · window {window} ({dates}) · service {service} ({env})

## Where the time goes
| # | Call (service · operation) | Type | avg ms | % of request | Code site |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
(one row per breakdown group ≥10% or ≥100ms, descending; note SEQUENTIAL/PARALLEL for outbound groups)

## Findings
(numbered; each: heuristic id, trace evidence, `file:line`, estimated saving, suggested fix — one sentence each)

## Sampled traces
(trace IDs + their durations, as links: https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/trace/{trace_id})

## History
| Date | Status | p95 | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
(append-only, newest first; one row per *change*, not per run; the first row is the creation: "Initial report")
```

**Change detection — the core invariant:** compute the fingerprint from
- status,
- p95 bucketed coarsely (nearest 100ms below 1s, nearest 500ms above — absorbs noise),
- the **unordered set** of bottleneck groups at ≥10% of total (capped at the 3 largest — same inclusion rule as the breakdown table), each as `service:operation` with %-of-total rounded to nearest 10%, sorted alphabetically before joining (an ordered list would churn when two similar-sized groups swap ranks between runs),
- the sorted set of finding IDs (heuristic id + code site).

If it equals the stored fingerprint → **do not touch the file** (the index records "verified, unchanged"). If it differs → rewrite the stats/breakdown/findings sections, update both timestamps, set the new status, and append one History row stating what changed (e.g. "p95 8.4s → 2.1s after {namespace}-XXX; sequential-calls finding resolved; status 🚨 → ⚠️").

### 7. Index

Rewrite `{Env}/API_Performance/_index.md` (the index of the environment being scanned) every run: a table of all tracked APIs (status, p95, error %, hits, last changed, link) sorted worst-first, plus a short run log line (`{timestamp} — {n} APIs seen, {m} flagged, {k} report files changed`). `{n}` is the count of distinct entry routes that survived BOTH step-1 filters (verb prefix + server-kind) — not raw buckets, not folded client spans — so the number is comparable across runs. `{k}` counts per-API report files only — the index itself is rewritten every run by design and never counts as a change. The index is the only file that changes on a no-news run.

### 8. Persist (commit + push — automatic)

If `findings_root` lives inside a git repository, commit and push the run's changes automatically — reports are only useful if teammates and other machines can see them, and a loop that leaves work unpushed silently loses it:

```bash
cd {findings_root}
git add {relative path to Backend/DataDog/}
git commit -m "dd-api-performance: {env} sweep {YYYY-MM-DD} — {m} flagged, {k} reports changed"
git pull --rebase && git push
```

- Commit only when the run changed something (`{k}` > 0, an index update, or a migration); skip silently on a pure no-op.
- Scope the `git add` to the `Backend/DataDog/` tree — never sweep unrelated workspace changes into the commit.
- If the push fails (offline, auth), say so clearly and leave the commit local — do not retry-loop, and never force-push.
- If `findings_root` is not in a git repo, skip this step silently.

### 9. Summary to the user

End with: traffic table, flagged list with statuses, which files were created/updated/untouched, whether the findings commit was pushed, and the single worst finding of the run in one sentence.

## Portability

Copy the `aa-dd-api-performance/` folder to any repo + register in that repo's AGENTS.md. Everything project-specific comes from that repo's `.claude/skill.config` (auto-populated on first run) and its own Datadog connection. The heuristics catalog is self-contained above (with an upgrade path via `aa-api-dd-compare` when present); the verb-prefix entry-span rule and the heuristics are tracer-conventional, not stack-specific.

## Loop usage (hint, not implemented here)

Designed to be invoked daily (e.g. `/loop` or a scheduled agent). Caveat: the Datadog MCP is interactively authenticated — schedule it in a session where the MCP is connected; in headless runs the skill stops at the prerequisite check by design.
